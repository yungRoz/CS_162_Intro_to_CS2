# CS_162_Intro_to_CS2
### Assignments for CS 162 Intro to CS II ###

Course involved: 
* The design and implementation of programs with:
  * multiple classes, structures
  * hierarchies of classes that use inheritance and polymorphism
  * understanding of abstraction, modularity, separation of concerns, exception handling

* Construction and use of basic linear structures (arrays, stacks, queues, and various linked lists) in programs, and ability to describe instances appropriate for their use
* Classification of moderately complicated algorithms in various complexity classes: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n2)
* Development of test-data sets and testing plans for programming projects
* Production of recursive algorithms, and when to choose between iterative and recursive algorithms
